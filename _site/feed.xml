Yesterday, Puzder and the parent company of his Carl’s Jr. fast-food chain were hit with a class action lawsuit for wage suppression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re keeping track, Puzder is also under fire for previous comments admitting that 40% of his employees were undocumented and for personally employing an undocumented worker as his maid for years - and only paying taxes for this worker after he was nominated to the Cabinet. All of these actions are, of course, violations of the laws our Labor Department is supposed to enforce. (A normal President would have long since forced such a nominee to withdraw, but Trump assumes that if he can push Betsy DeVos through, he can do anything.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Puzder’s Senate confirmation hearing scheduled for next Thursday, it seems his only real qualification for this job was the $300,000 he gave to Donald Trump and the Republican Party in last year’s election So tell your Senators we need to see a few more resumes for this position because Andy’s record is just a little too raggedy. Let’s aim for a Labor Secretary with experience defending our labor laws - not breaking them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="call now" /><category term="confirmation hearing" /><summary type="html">Today’s Daily Action is to call your senators to reiterate that Andy Puzder is a terrible–and now even more vulnerable–choice for Secretary of Labor.

While we are disappointed in this decision, it will not change our plans – the event is still on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to make a powerful, positive statement that we want to work with her and she ought to be present . After a couple speeches from local luminaries taking a stand against the Trump agenda, we’ll invite the audience to share questions, stories, and messages which we’ll record and pass along to the Senator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also want to help attendees get more involved in the movement so we’re inviting representatives from local activist and community groups to distribute information and answer questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re still lining up the details, but we are in talks with some speakers we think you’ll be pretty pleased with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that an RSVP does not constitute a reservation. We’ll let you know when the event details are finalized and (free) tickets become available.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="town hall" /><summary type="html">We have gotten confirmation from Senator Feinstein’s office that she will NOT be attending this event.
